# The PO and the PSPO Certification

I took the PSM 1 certification in the last quarter and realised that either these two exams should be taken together (if you are just interested in certifying yourself on both) or should be taken with the PO mindset or SM mindset for PSPO and PSM, respectively.

## The Chicken and the Pig
To understand the need for scrum, there's a popular fable that's used in workshops. It goes something like this: 

Once a chicken and pig decided to work on a project together. Their project was a dish called a 'Bacon and Egg'. When producing the dish made of eggs with bacon, the pig provided the bacon which required its sacrifice and the chicken provided the eggs, which was not difficult to produce. 

 the pig is really committed to that dish ("has skin in the game") while the chicken is only involved, yet both are needed to produce the dish.

The business fable of The Chicken and the Pig is about commitment to a project or cause. 
Managers, Stakeholders, customers are not actually involved in the actual making of the process (i.e. they don't write code, they don't create deliverables). 


## What is Scrum?
Scrum is a lightweight adaptive framework for managing complex development projects. It consists of __roles__, __artifacts__, __events__ with a simple set of rules to govern the interaction between them.

## The Product Owner
- Maximizes the Product Value
- Manages the Product Backlog
- Representation for the users
- Single Person

### Scrum Master/ Team Leads
- Shepard of Scrum 
- Servant Leader
- Removes Impediments
- Resolves Conflicts

### Development team
- Cross Functional (UX/Dev/BAs/etc)
- Self organizing teams
- Attend Daily Scrum.   
- Highly collaborative/ Collaborate on product features.  
- 5 to 9 members
- Discuss scenarios.  
- Other feedback.  

## Artifacts 

### Product Vision 
- Target Market
- Business Need/Opportunity 
- Key Features
- Value to the Company

### Product Backlog
- Single source of all requirements
- Constantly evolving
- Ordered based on Value
- Estimated by the Development team

### Release Plan
- Forecast Based on Empirical Data
- Overlay on the Product Backlog
- Updated Every Sprint

### Sprint Backlog
- Product backlog items for a sprint
- Plan to Deliver a Product Increment 
- Owned by the Developement Team 
- Dynamic and Highly Visible

### Burndown Chart 
- Tracks Work Remaining by Day
- Updated by the Development Team
- Displayed Prominently

### Impediments List
- Anything blocking or affecting performance
- Updated by the Scrum Team
- Monitored by the Scrum Master

## Events 
- Determine __What__ will be Delivered
- Past Performance/ Capacity
- Determine __How__ it will be delivered
- Create Sprint Backlog

### Sprint 
- Timeboxed for one Month or Less
- Clearly stated sprint goal
- Potentially releasable increment
- Scope is set by the Scrum Team

### Daily Scrum 
- Timeboxed to 15 minutes 
- Inspect our work done yesterday**
- Plan for today**
- Any possible impediments** 

### Product Backlog Grooming*
- Clarifying and Estimating New Items
- Reviewing Higher Priority Items
- Less Details on Lower Priority Items
- Around 10% of the Sprint

## PO & Product Backlog, according to the scrum guide
A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.

The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management.  
● Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;   
● Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;   
● Ordering Product Backlog items; and,   
● Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.   

The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:     
● Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;   
● Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;    
● Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,    
● Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.    


__Topic One:__ Why is this Sprint valuable?
The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

__Topic Two:__ What can be Done this Sprint?
Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.

During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation

__Scrum Artifact:__ For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.

__Product Backlog__
The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.

The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

__Commitment: Product Goal__
The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.
A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.
The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.

__Commitment: Sprint Goal__
The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.
