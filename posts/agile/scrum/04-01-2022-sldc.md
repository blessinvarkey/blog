# Software Development Life Cycle 

## Typical phases of SDLC 

## 1. Initiation phase: 
Evaluate if the proposed concept or solution fits in the organizationâ€™s mission, budget. Analyse and understand if the project with five proper returns on investment cost feasibility analysis etc.

- UPP (Unified Project Plan)
- SoW (Statement of Work)Provides an overview of the project, focuses on the project objectives and project deliverablesOrients business management, however, can be referred by all stakeholders  
- Contains fewer jargonsFeasibility Reports: Feasibility, Desirability, Marketability of the project. Software tools, - 

Cost-Benefit Analysis: Cost spent on the project- Request for Proposal (RFP): 
Statement of Work (SoW):Legally binding document providing details of the project.
 
Objectives -> Scope of Work -> Assumptions, Risks & Dependencies -> Roles and Responsibilities -> Deliverables & Timelines -> Pricing -> Acceptance Criteria -> Change Request Process

## 2. Requirement Analysis: 
Longest & most important phase in the SDLC. Talk to various stakeholders to gather requirements and revert with questions. Identifying the scope of the project and setting the project expectations.  

### 2.1. SRS Document: 
- Mother Document, created towards the end of the requirements phase. 
- Provides a blueprint of the way a system is expected to function
- Determine the extact project requirements
- Functional and Non functional Requirements
- One to One Mapping
- Software/ Hardware

_Table of Contents_
1. Introduction
2. Specific Requirements
3. System Attributes 
4. Change Management Process

### 2.2. User Interface Specification Document: 

_Characteristics:_
Non ambiguous, complete, verifiable, consistent, accessible, familiar, customisable

Approach will vary for web pages and mobile pages

_Table of Contents_
1. Widgets (Widgets used - radiobutton, checkbox etc)
2. Application Window View (Full Screen mode, default view)
3. Component Characteristics 
4. Fonts (type, size etc)
5. Colours (color combination, border color, bg, rgb combination)
6. Layout 

Requirements Analysis
Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, User Stories

### Product Backlog:

An ordered list of requirements that a scrum team maintains for the product 
Created and Maintained by the product owner

### Prioratisation Criteria:
High Risk Item -> Business values (business gain) -> Date Needed (time sensitive) -> Dependencies (critical dependency)

Product Backlog Consists of:
- Features 
- Bug Fixes 
- Non functional Requirements 

### Sprint Backlog: 
- Development team are the owners of the sprint backlog
- A list of work the development team must address during each sprint.
- Derived by the scrum team/dev team selecting product backlog items from the top of the product backlog

### User Story 
Basic unit of scope in an Agile project and describes the who, what and why of a requirement

#### Author
Product Owner with input from stakeholders
Replaces
Long and elaborate requirements document
Acceptance Criteria
- Shows that the story has been implemented as expected 
- Should be 'testable'

### Benefits
An effective way of breaking down requirements into prioritied and testable pieces of work

## 3. Design 
System Design Documents 
SDD is a combination of:
- HLDD: High Level Design Document
- LLDD: Low Level Design Document

- Introduces the program to a programmer
- Describes the problem, the approach to solve it and assumptions
- Helps future programmers locate the portion of the code to modify as needs change
Helps managers decicde whether the proposed solution fits into the bigger picture or not

_Table of Contents_
1. Introduction 
2. Interface Design 
3. Design Considerations
4. System Architecture
5. Detailed Design
6. Data Design Phase
7. Boundary Condition
8. Implementation Strategy


## 4. Development (parallel with documentation)
User Manual, Traning Manual, Capabilities Document
These documents are _mostly_ authored by Developers. 

Forms the bridge between the developer and the user
Provides guidance to the user for working with the product 
Acts as a friend in need

Others - Unit Test Cases, Reference Documents

## User Documentation

### Training Manual: 
- These are created for beginners, how to do basic tasks 
- Familarises the interface
- Does not cover all the tasks
- Organized from simple to complex
- Gradually builds a conceptual model

### User Manual/User Guide
- Provides overviews, explainations
- Address the full range of tasks
- Organized based on user tasks
- Gives step by step instructions

### Capabilities Document
- Provides info about the product
- Sets out who it is intended for 
- Helps evaluate machine and software requirements

## User Manual
Task-based/Role-based, Fact-filled, Concise, Coherent, Complete, Illustrative

_Table of Content_
1. Introduction 
2. Gettin started 
3. Task Chapter 
4. Appendices

_Procedures of a task_
Introductory lines (e.g. log in to the application) -> Navigation (e.g. Click on the hyperlink) -> Steps -> Screens -> Results

## 5. Testing
- Test Plan
- Test Cases
- Test Stories
- Prepared after the test design is complete
- Specifies exact input values, output values and steps to set up the test
- Talk about the details of the test the user has to perform

Write as if you are preparing a user's manual for a testing professional 
Be specific about the environment - even a slight deviation might cause unexpected results

Test plan ->Identifier -> Scope -> Approach -> Pass/Fail Criteria -> Test Deliverables -> Env Needs -> Responsibilities -> 
Risk & Contingencies -> Schedule

## 6. Go-Live

## 7. Maintenance 

## 8. Obsolescence - end/decommision/death of the application
