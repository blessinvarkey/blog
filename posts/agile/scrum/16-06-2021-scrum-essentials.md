## Scrum Utilizations: 
- Research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities. 
- Develop products and enhancements. 
- Frequently release products and enhancements. 
- Develop and sustain cloud and operations for product use. 
- Sustain and renew products. 

## Scrum Theory
- Empirical process control theory, or empiricism
- Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. 
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimise predictability and control risk. 
- Framework, not methodology

## Three pillars of Scrum
### Transparency:
- Requires a common standard
- Common Definition of Done

### Inspection:
- Inspect scrum artifacts
- Inspection should not get in the way of the work
 
### Adaptation:
- Adjustments are made ASAP to minimise additional deviations
- Scrum prescribes four events for inspect + adapt
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Scrum 
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Values
- Focus
- Respect
- Openness
- Commitment
- Courage
