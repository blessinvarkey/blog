|Column|Information| Definition|
|---|---|---|
|Accuracy| Overall correctness of predictions | Higher the value, better the model|
|AUC | Area Under Curve | This is a measure of ratio between true positive and False positives|
|Recall| Ratio of true positive with sum of true positive and false negative| This gives the fraction of good classifications that are done with respect to overall classification| 
|Prec| Precision Ration of True positive with sum of true positive and false positive| Used when the cost of false positive is greater that that of getting a false negative|
|F1|Balance between precision and recall|More useful than accuracy in determining model quality when the data contains widely different number of data for each class|
|Kappa | THe degree of arrangement between true values and predicted values|
|MCC|Matthews correlation coefficient|A measure of quality of classifications. Used only in case of binary classificiation|
|TT| Time taken| Time taken in seconds for model to predict the output after an input is given to it|
