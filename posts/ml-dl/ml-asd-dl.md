## Machine Learning and Computer Vision in Autism Spectrum Disorder Research 

The last decade has seen a substantial increase in the rate at which data is generated and produced. The growth in volume is due in the large part of the availability and infrastructure, used to collect and analyse many different types of information. 

The rise of computing power and processing technologies has also given rise to application of machine learning theories in different fields of study. One such field is ASD research. 

### Autism Spectrum Disorder
ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction in addition to restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour. The main signs of ASD are lack of public contact and communication, patterns of repeated behavior, attitudes and actions. Though ASD is seen at an early stage of development, certain defects and behavioral patterns may not be identified as symptoms unless in significant steps they impact the life of the child. Functional weaknesses differ from individual to individual with ASD and may change over time as well. For children till 18 months of age, signs of ASD are usually diagnosed. But with that, ASD may not be noticed until the school year, if the infant has minimal speech delay. The diagnosis is usually made in such situations where children have issues with peers or interactivity with them. The physicians used various methods and strategies in combination with diagnostic tools for the treatment of ASD. The method of classification is used for diagnosis in most of these studies. [R1]

### Machine Learning
Machine Learning can be divided into two categories: supervised and unsupervised learning. 

- Supervised learning machines : involve algorithms that use __input variables__ to predict a __target classification__ (dependent variable) which may be categorical or continous. Supervised learning uses datasets where the target prediction is known at training time for the data used to learn the model. A K-fold cross validation strategy seperates the available data into K-subsets and trains the model on all but one of the subsets and tests on the remainder. The process is repeated until the model has been trained on all the available data.
