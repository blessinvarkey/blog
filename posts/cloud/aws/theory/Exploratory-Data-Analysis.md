# Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Sanatize and prepare data for modeling - Using descriptive statistics to understand data better: Overall statistics, Multivariate statistics and Attribute Statistics
2. Perform feature engineering   
3. Analyse and Visualise data for ML   

- Identifying correlations between attributes is important, because they can impact model performance
- **Scatter plots** visualize relationships between numerical variables
- **Correlation matrices** help you quantify the linear relationships among variables
