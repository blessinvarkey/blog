# Use Cases of AWS Cloud Computing: AWSome Day Conference 2021

In its AWSome Day Conference 2021 the AWS team along with Intel, provided an overview of the AWS services and its latest use cases. While the conference extensively explored the services, for the purpose of this blog, I'll be highlighting three use cases I found interesting. 

Let's dive into it.

## 1. Use Case: NFL Real Time Stats using Amazon Rekognition & AWS SageMaker

When the National Football League (NFL) - the highest professional level of American football in the world -  was generating more than 3 terabytes of data with more than 1500 hours of play time per week, they needed a way to display real time stats for announcers and for journalists. They worked with Amazon ML Solutions Lab ([Next Gen Stats](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/new-next-gen-stats-powered-by-aws-debut-for-the-2021-22-nfl-season)) where live, real-time data (while the players were playing) was collected from the RFID tags on the players was streamed to AWS and modelled and processed using the Amazon SageMaker.

## 2. Use Case: Nestle's chain of origin coffee cultivates supply chain transparency with Amazon Managed Blockchain

The world's largest food and beverage company Nestle is the biggest procurer of coffee in the world. When they wanted to uncover transparency around its coffee bean supply chain beyond its brokers and buyers they turned to Amazon Managed Blockchain to trace back through every step in its supply chain - from the farmer and grader to the roaster and packer.
Nestle can grow one-on-one relationship with coffee farmers and roasting facilites. Because the secure blockchain ledger is public, it provides greater accountability to everyone in the supply chain.
