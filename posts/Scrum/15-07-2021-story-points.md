# Calculating the story points

One of the challenges of implementing scrum/agile in a new project can be the story point estimation. Story points are intended to make estimating easier by comparing the effort it will take for one user story, relative to the other user stories in the product backlog. However, a rough estimation of time per story point (perhaps while trying it out for the first time) can be set according as following: 

| Time  | Story point  |
|---|---|
| 30 minutes |1 |
| 1 hour | 2  |
| 2 hours | 4  |
| 4 hours | 8  |
| 1 days | 16  |
| 2 days | 32  |
| 3 days | 48  |

The estimated time per story point is taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrHpXvDXVrw) by Dan Chuparkoff from Jira. However it is not standard. 
Ideally, a user story should not take more than three days. 

Another way to assign story points is by taking the shirt size example. Like the size of a shirt S, M, L, XL, XXL, a story that is assigned 2 story points (XL) should be twice as much as a story that is assigned 1(L) story point. It should also be two-thirds of a story that is estimated 3 (XXL) story points.
