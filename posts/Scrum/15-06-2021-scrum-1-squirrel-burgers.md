## Delivering Squirrel Burgers 

Bob is a student who has been interning at Burger Kitchen for over a year. One night, his manager has to leave early so they ask Bob to close the kitchen by 11 pm. A customer (who introduces himself an old customer of Burger Kitchen) walks in at 10:45 pm and requests a Double Chicken Burger with extra cheese, onions, and a large order of fries. Bob does the math and says that the meal would cost $ 6.50. The customer takes out $1.7 and says he is really hungry and needs the Double Chicken Burger with the money he has.

What should Bob do in this situation?     
Pay the rest from his pocket?    
Say no to his last customer of the day?     

Bob thinks for a moment. He remembers seeing a dead squirrel on the pavement right outside the back door. He takes the dead squirrel to the kitchen, garnishes it, and gives it to the customer. The customer eats it and says it's the best burger he has ever had and walks away happily. 

Now, imagine a scenario where Alice, your manager, walks up to you and asks you to give her a rough estimate of when the new software/ feature can be developed or integrated. Or imagine you are a consulting firm bidding for a new project and your client Alice has asked you to give her a rough estimate of product delivery. You do the math and say "10 weeks". However, Alice says "how about in eight weeks?" You think for a moment and say, "okay". Alice makes a public announcement. 

In eight weeks, you deliver a sub-par product well garnished and presented. Alice post your presentation says "This is fantastic! I am rolling it out right away." 

Back to our squirrel story. 

One morning, Bob goes to work and learns that his company is facing a million-dollar lawsuit because the customer who was served the squirrel burger ended up in a hospital for three weeks. Meanwhile, Alice rolls out your product and loses her major clients. 

One of the advantages of using the Scrum framework is delivering a product built in a series of iterations. In the above analogy, it would be better to deliver a part/feature of the product instead of delivering a subpar product. It's also exteremly valuable to maintain courage and transparency.
