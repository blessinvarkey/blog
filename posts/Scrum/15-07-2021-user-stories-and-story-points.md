# User Stories And Story Points

_“Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!’” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them._ - Steve Jobs

### Q1. What are User Stories?

A user story describes functionality that will be valuable to either a user or purchaser of a system or software. User stories are composed of three aspects:   
- a written description of the story used for planning and as a reminder.  
- conversations about the story that serve to flesh out the details of the story.  
- tests that convey and document details and that can be used to determine when a story is complete.  

Spend time understanding a customer's habit, belief and problems rather than asking what they want [[1](https://productcoalition.com/dont-ask-users-what-they-want-8a842bce274b)]. To avoid the customer saying _"You built what I asked for, but its not what I need"_.  

Stories are easier to remember. 
Mike Cohn's video [[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q5-cVeNjCE)] on user stories. 
User stories are an example of a participatory design.

e.g.  on Travel Website:
- As a user, I want to reserve a hotel room
- As a user, I want to cancel a reservation
- As a premium user, I can cancel a reservation at the last minute
- As a non-premium user, I can cancel 24 hours before the trip.  
- As a frequent flyer, I want to rebook a past trip so that I can save time booking trips I take often

As a < __user role__ >, I < __want/need/can/etc__ > < __goal__ > so that < __reason__ >.

### Q2. How many user stories should be selected per sprint?

- 5 to 15 user stories for a 2-4 week sprint can be seen as a general trend, provided no user story takes more than 3 days. [[3](https://www.leadingagile.com/2015/05/how-many-user-stories-per-sprint-rules-of-thumb/)] 
- From Mike Cohn's blog: _"One possible solution to this common problem is that these teams are doing too many product backlog items per sprint. Based on data I analyzed on successfully finished sprints, I determined that a team should average around 1 to 1-1/2 user stories (product backlog items of any sort, really) per person per sprint. So, a six-person team should get somewhere around 6-9 user stories done per sprint."_ [[4](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/should-the-daily-standup-be-person-by-person-or-story-by-story)]


### Q3. How do we calculate the story points?

Story points are the estimates of effort as influenced by the amount of work, complexity, risk and uncertainity. Estimating the story point in a new project while implementing a scrum/agile methodology can be challenging. Story points are intended to make estimating easier by comparing the effort it will take for one user story, relative to the other user stories in the product backlog. 

The following estimated time per story point is taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrHpXvDXVrw) by Dan Chuparkoff. It is quite easy to implement, however it is not the standard.  

| Time  | Story point  |
|---|---|
| 30 minutes |1 |
| 1 hour | 2  |
| 2 hours | 4  |
| 4 hours | 8  |
| 1 day  | 16  |
| 2 days | 32  |
| 3 days | 48  |


Another way to assign story points is by taking the shirt size example. Like the size of a shirt S, M, L, XL, XXL, a story that is assigned 2 story points (XL) should be twice as much as a story that is assigned 1(L) story point. It should also be two-thirds of a story that is estimated 3 (XXL) story points.
