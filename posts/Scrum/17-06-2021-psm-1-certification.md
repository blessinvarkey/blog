# Preparing for the PSM examination

The scrum master certification path doesn't require a background in scrum, however, an exposure to product development/ agile methodology can help in preparing to pass the PSM (which requires 85% or higher) in a three day to a week long prep. 

A __thorough__ study of the [scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100) is enough to prepare you for the exam. Each line in the scrum guide is important. Once you are comfortable with the text, you can test your preparation with the following: 

- Test your current understanding of scrum by attempting the free [scrum open assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) by scrum.org. 

- Go back to scrum.org take the [Product Owner open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open) assessment and re-read the scrum guide until you consecutively score a 100% in the Scrum Open assessment and Product Owner open in less than 5 minutes. (PS: The time per question is much shorter on the real assessment.) 

- Attempt the [Mikhail Lapshin's](https://mlapshin.com/index.php/scrum-quizzes/) 1 hour exam in Real Mode. Review the areas where you went wrong and go back to the scrum guide. Try scoring between 85% - 100% atleast 3 - 4 times.

- Review the [scrum glossary](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary), especially the terms that you are not familiar with.  

- __If you have more time__, you can also read the [Nexus guide](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2021-01/NexusGuide%202021_0.pdf?nexus-file=https%3A%2F%2Fscrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdrupal%2F2021-01%2FNexusGuide%25202021_0.pdf). It's recommended, but isn't mandatory. 

Do note that the language used in the actual exam will be different from the mock and you might get a few scenario based questions too. In the exam, try not to take more than 30-40 seconds per question. If you feel stuck, bookmark the questions you would like to review at the end. The above preparation should give you enough confidence to take the exam!
