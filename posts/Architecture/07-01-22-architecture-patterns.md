# Architecture Pattern

## Layered Architecture Pattern

1. Presentation layer or UI layer 
2. Application layer or Service layer
3. Business layer or service layer 
4. Data access layer or persistence layer

## Event Driven Pattern

Event Driven architecture is easily adaptable to complex enviroments and can be easily extended when new event types appear. 

This kind of architecture is often used for asynchronus systems or user interfaces. Examples include weather forecast, stock trackers.

## Domain Driven Pattern

Object Oriented Approach

is about solving the problems of an organization. The Domain Model is about understanding and interpreting the important aspects of the given problems. 



## Pipes and Filters Architecture Pattern

This architecture decomposes a task that performs complex processing into a series of seperate elements that can be reused 

## Monolithic vs Microservices Arcitecture



## Design Pattern

In software enginering a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occuring proiblem within a given context in software edesign, design Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system

### Advantages of Design patterns
- Reusability
- Best practices: Formalized best practices that the programmer can use 
- Speedy development: With tested, proven development paradigms
- Better Mainability of code

Classification of Software 
- Creational Design Patterns
    - Abstract Factory Method
    - Singlton Pattern
-  Structural Design Pattern
    - Facade Pattern
    - Decorator Pattern 
- Behaviour Design Patterns 
    - Observer Pattern
    - Mediator Pattern
