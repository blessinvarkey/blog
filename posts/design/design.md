There are two systems of thought: 
Concious thought: Algorithmic thinking & Reflective thinking
Unconscious thought: 

### What do you see?

What did you see? A young woman or an old woman? 

The young woman's chin is the old woman's nose, and the old woman's eye is the young woman's ear.

## GOMS

GOMS is a model of human performance and it can be used to improve human-computer interaction efficiency by eliminating useless or unnecessary interactions.

GOMS is an abbreviation from:
G → Goals
O → Operators
M → Methods
S → Selection

## User Experience Design
User-centered design (UCD) is a design process that puts users at the center of product design and development. When a product team develops digital products, it takes into account the user's requirements, objectives, and feedback.
- The design/development team owns the final product. 

## Participatory Design

In PD, people destined to use the system play a critical role in designing it. The users give their inputs, but ultimately you are the decision maker and hold the power. 
- The user owns the final product. 

## Co-design
Your participants are treated as equals and have equal say in the decision making of the project goals and outcomes.

## Socio-Technical Systems design
Socio-technical systems design (STSD) methods are an approach to design that consider human, social and organisational factors, as well as technical factors in the design of organisational systems. 

The underlying premise of socio-technical thinking is that systems design should be a process that takes into account both social and technical factors that influence the functionality and usage of computer-based systems. The rationale for adopting socio-technical approaches to systems design is that failure to do so can increase the risks that systems will not make their expected contribution to the goals of the organisation. Systems often meet their technical ‘requirements’ but are considered to be a ‘failure’ because they do not deliver the expected support for the real work in the organisation. The source of the problem is that techno-centric approaches to systems design do not properly consider the complex relationships between the organisation, the people enacting business processes and the system that supports these processes.

The term socio-technical systems was originally coined by Emery and Trist (1960) to describe systems that involve a complex interaction between humans, machines and the environmental aspects of the work system—nowadays, this interaction is true of most enterprise systems. The corollary of this definition is that all of these factors—people, machines and context—need to be considered when developing such systems using STSD methods. In reality, these methods are more akin to philosophies than the sorts of design methods that are usually associated with systems engineering (Mumford, 2006). STSD methods mostly provide advice for sympathetic systems designers rather than detailed notations and a process that should be followed.

Product Development:
- First Principles thinking: Understand the root cause of why something works so you can adapt it to your problems and build great experiences 
- Know Your Users In Depth: You build products to solve someone else's problem. If you want to build something that will make people stop what they're doing... You need to constantly be aware of their needs.
- Test ideas early: Use wireframes, friends and fans to test the product
- The CEO Button: The CEO button is an unusual request from an executive to add a feature that completely destroys the balance of a project. [To be used in rare cases]
- How To Filter Feedback: You don't want to end up with a "watered-down" solution, where users are lost because of noise. Start with a clear purpose of the problem you're trying to solve. It will be easier to filter the feedback. 
- Skills Come With Repetitions: The more use cases you see, the better you get at recognizing patterns. You will also predict and expect what is coming faster.
