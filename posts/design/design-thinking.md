# Design Thinking 

_"Design Thinking is a human centered and collaborative approach with a designed mindset to solve complex problems_ - Tim Brown"

Over the last few months, I've got the opportunity to design and collaborate on a few Design Thinking projects. While collaborating with a DT team may feel quite natural (especially if you are coming from an agile background), designing a DT workshop or phase may require more flexibility in using the Design Thinking tools. 

So, lets first look at what Design Thinking process offers:

The core of Design Thinking is made of
- The Problem Space
- The Solution Space

## The Problem Space: Framing the right question
The problem space contains three which aim at understanding the user's/stakeholder's pain points and to frame the right question. 

_Empathy_: The Empathy phase is a Divergent phase. Opening up and listening to opportunities.  
_Define phase_: Covergent phase to make a point of view, and by synthesising insights to make the right questions.  


## The Solution Space: Creating the right solution
_Ideate Phase_: The ideate phase is a Divergent Phase. Brainstorming, idea generation
This can be done using personas, journey maps to understand 

### Value Proposition
_Prototyping_: Using prototyping techniques via iteration

_Testing phase_: Testing the solution with the user


Engage with empathy 
Craft insights
Co-create
Demonstrate your ideas
Integrate feedback
Trust the process
Stay positive
