# Design Thinking 

_"Design Thinking is a human centered and collaborative approach with a designed mindset to solve complex problems_ - Tim Brown"

Over the last few months, I've got the opportunity to design and collaborate on a few Design Thinking projects. While collaborating with a DT team may feel quite natural (especially if you are coming from an agile background), designing a DT workshop or phase may require more flexibility in using the Design Thinking tools. 

So, lets first look at what Design Thinking process offers:

The core of Design Thinking is made of
- The Problem Space
- The Solution Space

## The Problem Space: Framing the right question
The problem space contains three which aim at understanding the user's/stakeholder's pain points and to frame the right question. 

_Empathy_: The Empathy phase is a Divergent phase. Opening up and listening to opportunities.  
_Define phase_: Covergent phase to make a point of view, and by synthesising insights to make the right questions.  


## The Solution Space: Creating the right solution
_Ideate Phase_: The ideate phase is a Divergent Phase. Brainstorming, idea generation
This can be done using personas, journey maps to understand 

### Value Proposition
_Prototyping_: Using prototyping techniques via iteration

_Testing phase_: Testing the solution with the user


Engage with empathy 
Craft insights
Co-create
Demonstrate your ideas
Integrate feedback
Trust the process
Stay positive

## Conducting a virtual design sprint
The design sprints can be done using Zoom or MS Teams. If the stakeholder team is large, the team can be split in different into different rooms, after the introductions & the ice breakers. 

Stakeholder team should involve but not limit to:
- Business expert
- End user
- Designer
- Tech Expert 
- DT Coach

## The Sweet Spot for Innovation 
 in order to run a successful business or innovate, the product should
 - be desirable (someone wants it), - is technically feasible (i.e. it can be delivered )) and;
 - is business viable (it makes economic sense). 

The Desirability lens asks you to look at your customer;
How do they hear about you?
What brings them in the door?
What keeps them coming back?

Maybe you have a few different types of customers; can you articulate what each group finds most appealing?

The Feasibility lens focuses on the “back of house” aspects of your operation.
What needs to go on behind the scenes in order to create the magic for your customer?
Key staff members?
A recognizable and trusted brand?
Partnerships with industry leaders?

Ask yourself; what minor change to our operations would be diabolical?
What do we have in place to prevent that from happening?

The Viability lens is about the dollars.
Where do they come from?
Where do they get spent?
What’s our breakeven point?
Which of our customers are most profitable, and are we doing anything to pursue them?
