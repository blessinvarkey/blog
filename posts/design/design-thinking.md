# Design Thinking 

_"Design Thinking is a human centered and collaborative approach with a designed mindset to solve complex problems_" - Tim Brown

Over the last few months, I've got the opportunity to design and collaborate on a few Design Thinking projects. While collaborating with a DT team may feel quite natural (especially if you are coming from an agile background), designing a DT workshop or phase may require more flexibility in using the Design Thinking tools. 

_"People ignore design that ignores people"_- Frank Chimero


## Design Thinking
- DT is a tool, a creative process for finding effective solutions to problems
- It is a "human-centered approach to innovation"
- It is about looking at a problem and generating ideas to arrive at a solution
- It focuses on the user/customer and his needs. 

Design thinking is about embracing ambiguity. Its an iterative process which favours ongoing experimentation until the right solution is found.


## The DT Practitioner
__Adjectives__
- Confident
- Optimistic
- Curious
- Intutive
- Empathetic
- Resilient

__Verbs__
- Articulates clearly
- Collaborates
- Embraces risk
- goes the extra mile
- fails fast
- smiles and has fun

## Four Principles of Design Thinking

- __The Human Rule__: No matter what the context, all design activity is social in nature, and any social innovation will bring us back to the "human-centric-point of view"

- __The Ambiguity Rule__: Ambiguity is inevitable, and it cannot be removed or oversimplified. Experimenting at the limits of your knowledge and ability is crucial in being able to see things differently. 

- __The Redesign Rule__: All design is design. While technology and social circumstances may change and evolve, basic human needs remain unchanged. We essentially only redesign the means of fulfilling these needs or reaching desired outcomes.

- __The Tangibility Rule__ Making ideas tangible in the form of prototypes enables designers to communicate them more effectively. 


So, lets first look at what Design Thinking process offers:

The core of Design Thinking is made of
- The Problem Space
- The Solution Space

## The Problem Space: Framing the right question
The problem space contains three which aim at understanding the user's/stakeholder's pain points and to frame the right question. 

### Know Your Customer
The user may have functional, social, cultural and emotional needs, which needs to be documented. Two types of research: 
- Primary Research (interviewing, surveys)
- Secondary Research (market analysis, existing data)

Based on the research user personas can be defined. 

### I _Empathy_: The Empathy phase is a Divergent phase. Opening up and listening to opportunities. 
- Listen closely (actively) and if you thinkg you understand the how the user is feeling and why, express it back and see if it resonates with the user
- Practice Respect
- Try not to assume the role of a problem solver  


#### Best practices for interviewing
- Ask why
- When asking a question say don't use "usually.."
- Evoke stories, don't ignore them 
- Look for inconsistencies
- Pay heed to nonverbal cues
- When there is silence, don't intrude and wait for the user to think through and respond 
- You are not trying to find answers, only understanding the problem better
- Ask questions neutrally
- Ask binary questions
- Be prepared to capture

#### Empathy Map

### Personas

### Mapping Personas with Empathy Maps

### Journey Maps
A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal. 

Maps the relationship between customer and an organization over time and across all channels in which they interact with the business.

- A timescale (timeline)
- Scenarios 
- Touchpoints 
- Channels (where they work/perform the action)
- Thoughts and feelings

### II _Define phase_ : Covergent phase to make a point of view, and by synthesising insights to make the right questions.
- Realize new insights 
- Reframe the problem 
- Uncover opportunities

USER - NEED - INSIGHT
- NEEDS (as nouns): 
    - They are human, physical and emotional necessities. 
    - They capture the goals and motivations and desires (not solutions)
- INSIGHTS (Interesting, Relevant, Actionable): are expected things/ the 'why' response to the needs.

### Point of View (POV) template

- We Met: _User you are inspired by_ 
- We were surprised to notice:_tension, contradiction or surprise_
- We wonder if this means:_what did you infer?_
- It would be game changing to: _frame up an inspired challenge for yourself_

### How Might We
- Opens the exploration space to a range of possibilities 

How 
- Descriptive 
-

## The Solution Space: Creating the right solution
_Ideate Phase_: The ideate phase is a Divergent Phase. Brainstorming, idea generation
This can be done using personas, journey maps to understand 

### Value Proposition
_Prototyping_: Using prototyping techniques via iteration

_Testing phase_: Testing the solution with the user


Engage with empathy 
Craft insights
Co-create
Demonstrate your ideas
Integrate feedback
Trust the process
Stay positive

## Conducting a virtual design sprint
The design sprints can be done using Zoom or MS Teams. If the stakeholder team is large, the team can be split in different into different rooms, after the introductions & the ice breakers. 

Stakeholder team should involve but not limit to:
- Business expert
- End user
- Designer
- Tech Expert 
- DT Coach

## The Sweet Spot for Innovation 
 in order to run a successful business or innovate, the product should
 - be desirable (someone wants it), - is technically feasible (i.e. it can be delivered )) and;
 - is business viable (it makes economic sense). 

The Desirability lens asks you to look at your customer;
How do they hear about you?
What brings them in the door?
What keeps them coming back?

Maybe you have a few different types of customers; can you articulate what each group finds most appealing?

The Feasibility lens focuses on the “back of house” aspects of your operation.
What needs to go on behind the scenes in order to create the magic for your customer?
Key staff members?
A recognizable and trusted brand?
Partnerships with industry leaders?

Ask yourself; what minor change to our operations would be diabolical?
What do we have in place to prevent that from happening?

The Viability lens is about the dollars.
Where do they come from?
Where do they get spent?
What’s our breakeven point?
Which of our customers are most profitable, and are we doing anything to pursue them?

## Who is at the centre?
Its important to first identify our key stakeholders or the category of the stakeholders who fall within the design challenge (Why its also called Human Centered Design/ Stakeholder Centered Design/ User-Centered Design/ Employee-Centered Design).

SAP's Project Scope Stakeholder Canvas addresses four areas:   
1.  The Core Stakeholders   
2.  The Key Challenges (pain points we are trying to address)
3.  What does success look like? How will we know if we succeeded?
4.  Where we are right now? 
5. What would be a relief for the stakeholders?  

## Scope of the project 
- What are the key business challenges that you will focus on? 
- What are the barriers and constraints? 
- Where are your future opportunities?
What are your key success metrics? 


## How Might We

An article by the Nielsen Norman Group [[2](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-might-we-questions/)] states 

``` At the end of a discovery, the team should come together, agree on the top things it found out, and use this knowledge to frame design challenges. To prevent individuals from suggesting their pet solutions, which might have little resemblance to the problems found, construct How might we questions that frame the problem(s) for ideation.```

How Might We's start with 'How Might We' along with an action verb, without including a solution.  

### #1 Start with the Problems (or Insights) You’ve Uncovered

|||
|---|---|
|||
|Problem	| Users aren't aware of the full product offerings. |
|HMW	| How might we increase awareness of the full product offerings? |

### #2 Avoid Suggesting a Solution in Your HMW Question

|||
|--|--|
|||
|Insight|	Users are often unsure about which form to complete when they file their taxes.|
|HMW (poor)	| How might we tell users which form to complete to file their taxes?|
|HMW (good)	| How might we make users feel confident they are filing their taxes correctly?|

### #3 Keep Your HMWs Broad

|||
|--|--|
|||
|Insight|	Users often spend a long time checking their submission for mistakes.|
|HMW (good)	|How might we make it quick and easy for users to check their work for mistakes?|
|HMW (better) |How might we support users to efficiently draft submissions that they’re happy with?|
