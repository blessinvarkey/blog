# DesignOps

Dave Malouf phrased the coin 'DesignOps' in 2014.

__Definition:__ DesignOps refers to the orchestration and optimization of people, processes, and craft in order to amplify designâ€™s value and impact at scale.[[1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-operations-101/)]

DesignOps is a collective term for addressing challenges such as:
* growing and evolving design teams
* finding and hiring people with the right skills
* creating efficient workflows
* improving the quality and impact of design outputs.
The goal of DesignOps is to establish processes and measures that support scalable solutions for these challenges, so that designers can focus on designing and researching.
